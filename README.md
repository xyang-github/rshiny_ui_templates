# RShiny UI Template
This is a repository for me to recreate certain web design as templates to use in RShiny applications.

<h3>Progress Bar UI</h3>

There is a horizontal progress bar within a form tag. The form has multiple fieldsets, but only one fieldset is displayed at a time. The user navigates from one fieldset to another via the previous and next buttons at the bottom of the form. The progress bar number indicates the number of fieldsets, with the color change indicating progress along the fieldsets. A combination of HTML, CSS andn Javascript was implemented to create this template.
